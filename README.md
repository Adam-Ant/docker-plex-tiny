The _smallest*_ Plex Media Server docker image, built on barebones [spritsail/busybox](https://hub.docker.com/spritsail/busybox/) with glibc and libraries from source. The container contains a bare minimum glibc dependency tree, with most of the useless crap removed, resulting in the smallest container possible whilst maintaining full functionality.

You can find out more about the [spritsail/busybox](https://hub.docker.com/r/spritsail/busybox) base image [here](https://github.com/spritsail/busybox)
