The smallest* Plex Media Server docker image, built on [busybox](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox/) with glibc and packages from the debian repos. The container contains a bare minimum glibc dependency tree, with most of the crap removed.

You can find out more about the [adamant/busybox](https://hub.docker.com/r/adamant/busybox) base image [here](https://github.com/Adam-Ant/docker-busybox-base), with the "package manager" scripts around dpkg
